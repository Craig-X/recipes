    <h1>Foccacia with rosemary & sea salt</h1>
    
    <!--Image will be going right here-->

    <p>An easy no-knead, no nonsense bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <h3>Dough</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>250g flour</li>
        <li>200g water</li>
        <li>4g yeast</li>
        <li>4g salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A couple of sprigs of rosemary</li>
        <li>A couple fo tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>A couple of tablespoons of water</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
    
        </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough by mixing the flour, water, yeast, and salt in a big bowl. Use a spatula so your hands don't get messy.</li>
        <li>Leave the dough the bowl, and cover the top with a lid, damp cloth, or some clingfilm, so air can't get in</li>
        <li>Leave to prove for about 2 hours. Every 30 minutes, use a spatula to stretch and fold the dough in on itself. This action replaces the kneading.</li>
        <li>After 90/120 mins, the dough should 'feel' right. Liberally oil an 8in x 8in tin with olive oil, and spread the dough across the tin</li>
        <li>The dough may spring back on itself. This is normal. Cover, leave for 10 minutes and press the dough again if this happens. Poke the dough with your fingers all over, to make lots of holes. Leave to prove for 20-30 minutes</li>
        <li>Mix approx 1 tbsp of water and 1 tbsp olive oil. Whisk vigorously, and baste the top of your dough with the mix. </li>
        <li>Add chopped rosemary, and a sprinkle of flaky sea salt, and place in a pre-heated oven at 240 degrees celcius. Bake for 15-20 minutes.</li>

    </ol>

<p>This bread smells great. You might want to rest it for 5 minutes before serving. The cooking time is a rough guide - it typically takes some trial and error to know when the dough 'looks right'</p>

<p>If you want to make a garlic bread, you can take it out of the oven, baste the bread with garlic butter, and place back in the oven for 3-5 minutes. I'd advise against adding the garlic butter earlier as burnt garlic doesn't taste too good.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
