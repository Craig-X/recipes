    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g plain flour</li>
        <li>100g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>2g salt</li>
        <li>5g salt</li>
        <li>1g bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>120g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>200g milk chocolate</li>
        <li>50g walnuts</li>
        <li>80g white sugar</li>
        <li>80g soft light brown sugar</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roast the walnuts at 190 C (170 C fan)for 5 minutes. Allow to cool fully, and chop into small pieces. Chop the cholcate into small pieces as well, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix your cold, cubed butter in a stand mixer for about 10-20 seconds, to break up the pieces a bit</li>
        <li>Add the white & brown sugar and combine with the butter for 30-45 seconds until the butter has broken down into small lumps. Do not overdo this - you want lumps of butter in there!</li>
        <li>Mix in the walnuts and chocolate, for about 15 seconds, just enough to disperse in the mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, salt, baking powder & bicarbonate of soda. Mix for a short while until you get a sandy mixture with a few small lumps of butter.</li>
        <li>Mix in the beaten egg, and allow it to combine in the mixture. It's important that you let the mixture remain as a pebbly mixture, and don't allow it to form into one cohesive dough. One it starts forming little pebbles, stop mixing.</li>
        <li>Measure out 125g of mixture, and form into a ball. Don't overwork the ball - make sure the sandy/pebbly mixture is compacted together and holds together</li>
        <li>Freeze the dough balls for at least 2 hours, or ideally, overniht. Or even keep them in the freezer, ready for when you want delicious cookies.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies on a lined baking sheet at 210 C (190 C fan) for 15-16 minutes</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These cookies are best enjoyed after they've had about half an hour to cool down a little bit. They should be hard on the outside, with a soft, underbaked texture in the middle.</p>

    <p>Enjoy</p>
