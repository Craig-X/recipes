    <h1>Pancakes</h1>

    <!--Image of pancakes will be going here-->
    
    <p>Makes appoximately 6 sweet American-style pancakes</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>400g milk</li>
        <li>300g plain flour</li>
        <li>60g sugar</li>
        <li>10g baking powder</li>
        <li>pinch baking soda</li>
        <li>4g salt</li>
        <li>10-20g melted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Beat the egg, and then add in the milk, whisking until combined</li>
        <li>Add the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk until combined, taking care not to overmix. Remember that it's better to have a few small lumps than overmixed batter.</li>
        <li>Melt a small knob (Approx 10-20g) butter and stream into the mixture whilst mixing. Then allow the mixture to rest for a few minutes while you heat your pan.</li>
        <li>Cook the pancakes in a teflon pan on a medium heat, using a ladle to spoon into the pan. Cook each side for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Make sure that you serve the pancakes hot, and add the toppings of your choice. Nutella works really well, although maple syrup with a knob of butter is very hard to beat.</p>

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
